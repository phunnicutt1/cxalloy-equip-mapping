## Project Overview
CxAlloy Equipment Mapping & Analytics Platform - A Next.js application for mapping BACnet equipment points to CxAlloy equipment with template-based bulk operations and comprehensive analytics.

## Current State (September 2025)

### ‚úÖ Working Features
- **Auto-Process System**: Processes 23 TRIO files (~31,400 lines) from `/public/sample_data/` directory
- **Equipment Mapping Interface**: Three-panel UI for mapping BACnet to CxAlloy equipment
- **Point Tracking System**: Select and manage individual points with persistent state across equipment
- **Bulk Apply Tracked Points**: Copy tracked points from source equipment to multiple target equipment with merge/replace options
- **Smart Mapping Suggestions**: Intelligent equipment pairing suggestions shown in middle column header (confidence-based)
- **Template Database**: Full MySQL persistence for equipment mapping templates
- **Database Integration**: Full MySQL persistence with proper relationships
- **CSV Enhancement**: ConnectorData.csv integration for improved classification
- **Auto-Classification**: Automatic equipment type detection (AHU, VAV, CV, etc.)
- **Point Normalization**: Converts BACnet names to human-readable formats

### üîß Recent Work Completed (September 2025)
- **Simplified Point Tracking**: Removed complex point tracking template system in favor of direct bulk apply
- **Bulk Apply Dialog**: New modal for copying tracked points to multiple equipment with clear/merge options
- **Smart Suggestions UI**: Moved equipment mapping suggestions from left panel to middle column header
- **Persistent Point State**: Tracked points automatically restore when switching between equipment
- **Save All Mappings Fix**: Fixed to save tracked points for ALL mapped equipment, not just selected one
- **UI Cleanup**: Removed template dropdown from middle column, simplified header layout
- **State Synchronization**: Added useEffect to sync displayed points with persisted tracked points
- Successfully processing 23 TRIO files with ~31,400 lines of BACnet data
- Enhanced CSV processing with ConnectorData.csv integration
- 15 API endpoints for full functionality

### üéØ Workflow

1. **Process Data**: Click "Process All Files" to load TRIO files
2. **Select Equipment**: Choose BACnet equipment from left panel
3. **Map to CxAlloy**:
   - Click Map button on CxAlloy equipment in right panel
   - OR use Smart Suggestion button that appears in middle column header
4. **Track Points**: Click Track button on individual points in middle column
5. **Bulk Apply Points**: Click "Bulk Apply Tracked Points" button to copy points to other equipment
6. **Save Mappings**: Click "Save Mappings" to persist all equipment mappings and tracked points to database

### üêõ Known Issues & Considerations

1. **Database Dependency**: Requires active MySQL connection configured in `.env.local`
2. **Initial Setup Required**: Run `node scripts/setup-templates.js` to initialize template database
3. **Sample Data Processing**: 23 TRIO files in `/public/sample_data/` totaling ~31,400 lines
4. **Processing Performance**: Large file processing may take several seconds
5. **Point State Persistence**: Tracked points are stored in `trackedPointsByEquipment` and automatically restored when switching equipment
6. **Bulk Apply**: Target equipment must already be mapped to appear in bulk apply dialog

### üí° Commands & Testing

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build

# Lint
npm run lint

# Type check
npm run typecheck
```

### üîÑ State Management
- Uses Zustand for global state (`/store/app-store.ts`)
- **Key State Properties**:
  - `equipment`: BACnet equipment list with points
  - `cxAlloyEquipment`: CxAlloy equipment list
  - `equipmentMappings`: Current equipment mappings
  - `selectedEquipment`: Currently selected equipment
  - `selectedPoints`: Currently displayed point selections (UI state)
  - `trackedPointsByEquipment`: Persistent tracked points for each equipment (Record<equipmentId, Set<pointId>>)
  - `showBulkApplyDialog`: Controls bulk apply dialog visibility
- **Point Tracking Logic**:
  - When points are tracked, they're stored in both `selectedPoints` (current view) and `trackedPointsByEquipment` (persistent)
  - When equipment changes, `selectedPoints` is synced from `trackedPointsByEquipment`
  - Bulk apply reads from `trackedPointsByEquipment` to get all tracked points for each equipment

### üìä Database Schema
```sql
-- UNIFIED TEMPLATE SYSTEM (NEW)
unified_templates (
  id, name, description, equipment_type, category, vendor, model,
  source_equipment_id, source_equipment_name, source_bacnet_id, source_bacnet_name,
  template_type, is_built_in, is_default, usage_count, success_rate, effectiveness,
  created_at, updated_at, created_by, updated_by
)

template_points (
  id, template_id, template_point_id, name, description,
  point_function, object_type, units, required,
  bacnet_cur, bacnet_dis, bacnet_desc, nav_name,
  matching_facet, confidence, haystack_tags, display_order
)

template_applications (
  id, template_id, template_name, target_equipment_id, target_equipment_name, target_equipment_type,
  applied_points, matching_options, matching_results,
  application_type, is_successful, errors, applied_at, applied_by
)

-- Core equipment tables
equipment (id, name, type, totalPoints, processed_at, ...)
equipment_points (id, equipment_id, originalName, normalizedName, haystackTags, ...)

-- Analytics and tracking
audit_trail (id, entity_type, entity_id, action, changes, timestamp, ...)
processing_logs (id, file_name, status, processed_count, errors, ...)
```

### üöÄ Next Steps Recommendations
1. ‚úÖ ~~Implement database persistence for templates~~ (COMPLETED - now using MySQL)
2. Add template versioning and history
3. Enhance matching algorithms with ML-based suggestions
4. Add export functionality for mapped data
5. Implement user authentication and multi-tenancy

- When Save Mappings is clicked:

  1. Equipment Update (Working before):
    - Updates equipment table with ek_skyspark = bacnetEquipmentId
  2. Point Persistence (Fixed now):
    - For each tracked point:
        - Inserts/updates point table with point name and description
      - Retrieves point_id from database
      - Inserts/updates equipmentpoint table with:
            - fk_equipment = CxAlloy equipment ID
        - fk_point = point_id from point table
        - ek_skyspark = BACnet point ID (from point.id)
        - name = display name
        - is_tracked = 1
  3. Error Handling:
    - Catches and logs each point failure without stopping the process
    - Reports all errors back to user
    - Shows detailed error messages for debugging
