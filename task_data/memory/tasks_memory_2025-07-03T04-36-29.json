The implementation includes: 1) Complete Zustand state management system with equipment data, UI state, and panel controls; 2) Responsive three-panel layout with resizable panels (300px min left, 350px min right) and mobile support with overlay behavior; 3) Equipment browser with grouping by type, search functionality, and equipment/template view toggle; 4) Point details panel showing equipment metadata, point visualization with BACnet object type icons, and Haystack tag display; 5) CxAlloy integration panel with mapping operations and filtering capabilities; 6) Modern React patterns with TypeScript, shadcn/ui components, and clean component architecture; 7) Mock data integration demonstrating VAV controllers, lab air valves, and RTU controllers. The project compiles successfully and all core requirements are met with proper accessibility, responsive design, and state synchronization across panels.",
