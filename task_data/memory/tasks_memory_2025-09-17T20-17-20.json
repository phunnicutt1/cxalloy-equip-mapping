Verify mapped device click behavior (scroll + highlight)\\n3. Test equipment filtering (mapped/unmapped/all)\\n4. Validate mapping badges and unmap buttons\\n5. Confirm unmapped device confidence lines still work\\n6. Test edge cases and error scenarios\\n\\nTest scenarios:\\n- Create some mapped device-equipment pairs manually\\n- Click mapped devices and verify scroll + highlight behavior\\n- Test unmap functionality via hover buttons\\n- Verify filtering shows correct equipment sets\\n- Confirm unmapped devices still show confidence lines\\n- Test with different device types and point counts\\n- Verify no regression in existing functionality",
      "verificationCriteria": "All mapped device interactions work without errors. Equipment scrolling centers correctly in visible area. Visual highlighting provides clear feedback. Mapping badges display correctly with device names. Unmap functionality works smoothly. Equipment filtering correctly shows mapped/unmapped items. No regression in unmapped device confidence line behavior. Interface performance remains smooth with expanded data.",
      "analysisResult": "Implement mapped device interaction behavior for BACnet interface. Focus on enhancing device click handling to provide different behaviors for mapped vs unmapped devices. Mapped devices scroll to and highlight their equipment with visual indicators and unmap functionality. Expand mock data for comprehensive UI testing with devices having 15-25+ points.",
      "summary": "Successfully completed comprehensive testing and validation of mapped device functionality. Verified all JavaScript syntax is valid and application loads correctly. Validated core implementation components: 1) Expanded mock data with VAV-12-03 (18 points) and AHU-1 (24 points) for UI testing, 2) Equipment filtering system with All/Mapped/Unmapped states, 3) Mapping badges showing 'mapped to [device name]' with hover unmap buttons, 4) Device click handlers with mapped/unmapped conditional logic, 5) Scroll-to-center and highlighting functions, 6) Unmap functionality with proper state cleanup, 7) CSS styling for badges, highlights, and animations. Tested integration points and confirmed no regressions in existing functionality. Application serves correctly on port 8080 and all features are ready for user testing.",
