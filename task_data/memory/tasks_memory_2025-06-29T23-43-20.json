      "summary": "Successfully enhanced EquipmentReviewPanel with comprehensive normalized point display capabilities. Key achievements: 1) Enhanced PointCard component displaying original vs normalized names side-by-side with confidence scores, 2) Advanced search functionality working across original names, normalized names, descriptions, and Haystack tags, 3) Multi-dimensional filtering system (category, confidence level, normalization status) with dynamic counts, 4) Point categorization based on semantic classification (Temperature, Pressure, Airflow, Status, Control, Setpoint, Sensor), 5) Interactive confidence adjustment interface with range slider controls, 6) Comprehensive normalization statistics display showing coverage rates and confidence metrics, 7) Semantic metadata visualization including vendor-specific analysis and reasoning, 8) Created reusable PointNormalizationDisplay component for consistent normalization display across the application, 9) Enhanced UI with color-coded confidence badges, category tags, and visual status indicators, 10) Responsive design with proper loading states and empty state handling. The implementation provides intuitive point management with clear visual feedback for normalization status and confidence levels.",
